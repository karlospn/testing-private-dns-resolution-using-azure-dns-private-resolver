# Testing private resources DNS resolution over an Azure P2S VPN connection using Azure DNS Private Resolver

The purpose of this repository is to test the new Azure DNS Private Resolver resource.

To test it, we're going to try to resolve the DNS of a few private Azure resources when we're connected to an Azure Point-to-Site VPN connection.

This test uses Terraform to create and deploy the resources.

@Work in Progress.
